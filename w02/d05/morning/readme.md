#Kanye's New Visualizer#
##A JQuery Adventure##

"Yo mang, good to see you again", a giddy Kanye says, his zebra fur joggers glistening with ruby rhinestones.  "Thanks so much for helping me with my code on Monday.  Look, I got a new project for you".  He goes on to explain his new project.  Kanye is trying to elevate his next album to the next level.  He wants a website that his listeners can interact with while they are jamming to his latest album.  It's really weird, but he swears "it's the work of the gods".  But Kanye offers to take you on a helicopter tour over his new entertainment park, Golden Unicorn Palace, so you agree ("I just bought a new unicorn for $5 million!" he squeels).  

###Kanye's Specs###

* use the provided html, css, and JS pages.  You can use the html and css to reference the properties of each element, but __don't change anything in these files__.  All answers should be done in the JS file.
* All functions should log a message to the console stating what the function did.
* Feel free to log anything else that is helpful in solving the problems!

He wants:
1.  When you hover over box 1, box 2's height is set to 200px
2.  Hovering over box 2 makes box 1's height 20% smaller (in other words, 80% of what it was).
3.  Clicking on box 1 makes its _own_ height 20% bigger.
4.  Make a super powerful click on box 1!
    * the action of clicking _down_ on box 1 makes box 1 turn 'navy' and box 2 turn 'maroon'
    * the action of _releasing_ that __same click__ makes box 1's corners round.
     
    
Too easy?  Let's step it up!  Work together on this!
5. Modify the hover function from question 2 such that every 4th hover will cause the height of box 1 to double! For example:
    * 1st time the mouse goes over, the box gets 20% shorter.
    * 2nd time the mouse goes over, it shrinks another 20%.
    * 3rd time, shrinks another 20%.
    * 4th time, the height doubles.
6. Add a new event listener to box 2.  If the user double clicks box 2 three times, the box consumes the entire screen.  Keep in mind that you have to pause between each double click or the browser thinks you are just single clicking a bunch of times.
