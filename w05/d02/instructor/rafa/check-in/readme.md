# Intro

Express is our new friend! It will help us add the "Full Stack" prefix to our "Web Developer" badge we already own.

Express is a Web Application Framework. It leverages Node in order to make our life easier when interacting with incoming request for assets, services, etc.

# Instructions
#### Part1: Follow these steps to create an Express App:

  1. Navigate to the folder `new-express-app`
  2. Use `npm` in order to create a `package.json` file to track our dependencies for this project.
  3. Use `npm` to install `express`
  3. create a file named `index.js`
  4. In `index.js`. Bootstrap an Express server and listen on port `3000`
    1. Respond with a line of text that says `Express has been born!` to the browser, when it receives a Request for the '/' route.
  5. Use the browser to navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the text rendered on the screen.

##### Part2: Answer the following Questions:

1. what is a module in Node?

2. What version of node are you running?

3. What is the node console and how can you use it to calculate the square root of 81?

4. Are JSON and JavaScript Objects the same thing? Explain.

# Deliverables
